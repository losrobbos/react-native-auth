# React Native sample

Find here a code sample for a React native app which uses:

- Context API for State Management
- Axios for API communication

## Setup

Please clone this repo and create a file ".env.js" in the main folder. 

Copy the contents of the file ".env.sample.js" into that file and adapt the API url. 

But for testing out you can leave the existing dummy ToDo API Url.
